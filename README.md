# so_much_swig
An example for using swig to turn c++ into a python module.
Wraps a simple c++ class and passes numpy arrays to functions.
Also shows some exception throwing and catching.

## Building
To build the module, run commands:

`cmake .`

`make`

Output will be in the root directory. Messy, but simple to understand.

If you change this, be aware that:
* numpy.i must be in the same directory as so\_much\_swig.i
* To import from python, output file so\_much\_swig.py must be findable by the importer

You may also wish to test the c++ without involving python. To do so, complile so\_much\_swig.cpp by itself like so:

`g++ so_much_swig.cpp`

## Running
To test the module in python run:

`python test_swig.py`

Check that file for details on how to use the completed swig module and be sure to note the minor difference in function calls for show\_array being called in python and when it is called in c++.

To test the c++ class by itself, do the compilation step mentioned above and then run the resulting executable.
